&#x4e00; &#x4e8c; &#x4e09;

this is a simple version of a fun chinese dice game - i have called it &#x4e00; &#x4e8c; &#x4e09; (1 2 3) as this is what most people shout whilst playing it ðŸ¤£

the worst possible combination of pips ðŸŽ² is 1 2 3 as this is an instant loss - hence people shouting  yi (1) er (2) san (3) as the other players roll the dice ðŸ˜›

there are various rules to the game - this is just my simple version of it ðŸ˜ƒ

rules to this version:

- 1 2 3 is an automatic loss - whoever rolls it first loses
- 4 5 6 and any triple roll is an automatic win - whoever rolls one of these first wins
- if the above conditions do not apply, the sum of the pips is used - the largest sum wins
- it is possible to draw if the sums are equal
- player one button is clicked first
- player two button must be clicked for the round to complete properly - even if player one has an automatic loss or win - if this annoys you, please feel free to fork the project and alter it ðŸ™‚
