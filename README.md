&#x4e00; &#x4e8c; &#x4e09;

this is a simple version of a fun chinese dice game - i have called it &#x4e00; &#x4e8c; &#x4e09; (1 2 3) as this is what most people shout whilst playing it ðŸ¤£

the worst possible combination of pips ðŸŽ² is 1 2 3 as this is an instant loss - hence people shouting  yi (1) er (2) san (3) as they want the other players to roll it ðŸ˜›

there are various rules to the game - this is just my simple version of it ðŸ˜ƒ
